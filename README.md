# Synthetic-Medical-Image-Generato-Using-Gans
The Synthetic Medical Image Generator leverages GANs to produce realistic medical images, addressing challenges of limited and sensitive datasets. By training a generator and discriminator in six structured stages, the project creates synthetic data that supports diagnostic model training, enhances research, and fosters innovation in healthcare AI.
